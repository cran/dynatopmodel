Version 1.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES

* Return flow is calculated by determining by any excess over limiting transmissivity of net upslope input.

MAJOR CHANGES
* A logical error has been fixed in the calculation of maximum subsurface lateral transmissivity. This meant that too much surface runoff was being generated at low values of ln_t0.

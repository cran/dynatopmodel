Version 1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES

* The kinematic routing between HRUs is solved by the lsoda implicit algorithm accessed via the 1D ODE solution deSolve::ode method 
* Routines are now exported that preprocess each component of the data to supply to the core calculation:
 build_routing_table: generate the network width table
 build_chans: generate the channel network raster from a vector DRN or the wetness index
 build_layers: add upslope area and wetness index to catchment elevation raster

Example case included is now for the Bromopton catchment in Norh Yorkshire.

MAJOR CHANGES

* removed / deprecated many of the project management and preprocessing routines in order to make components of the calculation clearer.
The project source will be hosted on GitHub to allow access to the routines.
These include:
add.disc
run.proj
save.proj
apply.params            
build.calib.set      
create.proj             
disc.catch             
write.disc             
write.proj              

* disp.run functionality supplied by disp_output
* disc.catch renamed discretise
